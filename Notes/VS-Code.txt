The days of Sublime are over as VSCode is beating all editors badly.
Kudos to Microsoft, as they came up with open source editor:: Visual Studio Code.
The git integration, the task runner integration, js debugging, Intellisense, parameter hinting all are awesome features.

The little bit worrying things with VSCode Ide is language and package support.
As Far as javascript is concerned (FYI:: I am a Node JS developer) VS code support like a charm with a large packages available to start with.

Providing in built terminal makes it awesome.

If you Starting a new project then go with Visual Studio Code.
