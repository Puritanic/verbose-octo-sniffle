Continuous Integration
During the developement, developer used to commit lots of changes to shared repo. so every time code is commited (integrated) in repo, there should be a mecahnisam to test whether it is not breaking the application. (any kind of regression is not there).This kind of practice while development is called as continuous integration.

If you dont integrate continuously, you will have very log periods between integration. so it will be hard to detect/fix the problems/issues which will arise during integration.Such Integration problems can easily knock a project off or cause-it to fail altogether.

CI Tools are kind of one click deployment tools.

There are different tools to achieve continous integration.some of are self hosted while for others you have to install & configure them.
