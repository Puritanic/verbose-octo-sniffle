Media source Extension API

Till now, playing audio and video in web was available thorugh various plugins or some non-standard clinet server protocol like RTMP.
MSE will provide a funactionality to support media without any plugins and which will work on standard  HTTP protocol.

As of now the basic feature is playing single track as a whole.but when you want to play track in stream, allowing to achieve Adaptive bitrate streaming, you have to use protocols like DASH which are build on top of MSE API.

DASH => Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP
it specifies how adaptive bitrate should be feteched.amongst Apple's HLS, Adobe's HDS and DASH, the last one has more platform support.
Two most common use for DASH is "On Demand" content and "LIVE" content.
In "ON Demand" content, it will allow developer time to change the media in different qualities.
"LIVE" profile content can introduce latency due to transcoding and broadcasting , so DASH is not suitable for realtime communication like WebRTC.It can however support significantly more client connections than WebRTC.
