1)  Introduction to MPEG-DASH
    Nirmal Patel

2) Overview
    what is Dash ? how it is different from other streaming technology ?
    Browser Compatibility
    MSE API
    DASH library -- dash.js
    media representation description

    Reference
    ==========
    MPEG ==> Moving (Motion)Picture Expert Group ==> An International standard for encoding and compressing video images.
    MP4 ==> MPEG4 
    H.264 ==> MPEG4 part10 (AVC) advance video coding ==> video compression standard ==> aim is to  provide good video quality at lower bitrates ==> also allowed the standards to be applied to wide variety of standards and networks  and systems including low/high bitrate , low/high resolution video , broadcast etc
    Currently there are 3 major vendor-centric streaming formats (all takes H.264 as input)

3) Why Dash

    Microsoft Smooth Streaming
    Http Live Streaming
    Http Dynamic Streaming

    dash js codec agnostic
    Agnostic, in an information technology (IT) context, refers to something that is generalized so that it is interoperable among various systems. 

    Reference
    =========
    Why is it important to be codec agnostic? Simply because vendors like Apple, Google, Adobe and others have proprietary codecs that don’t play well with their competitor’s devices. You can’t avoid these vendors, because their devices/services are popular (iOS, Android, Windows, Youtube, etc.). What you can do is try to please everyone by not troubling the consumer about it.

4) Dash js

    A JavaScript-based library which enables DASH playback via HTML5
    Handled by DASH-IF
    open Source
    Media Source Extension API
    supports wide array of features

5) Compatibility / Browser Supports

    its based on Browser's MSE implementation.so anything supporting MSE, DASH js player can be implemented.

    Firefox 42+
    Google Chrome
    Internet Explorer 11 Windows 8.1
    Microsoft Edge
    Opera
    Safari 8 on OS X

    not supported in safari on iOS.

5) Media Presentation Description
   
   two basic components in stream
   Media (video or audio)
   Metadata (manifest file)

   manifest file .mpd

   contains all metadata information for streaming

    Pipeline

    These pipelines are like queues that manage your jobs. Transcoder processes jobs in the order in which they’re added to the pipeline. Pipelines can be one of two types – standard priority jobs and high priority jobs. From the name itself it’s clear that if you want the file to be transcoded immediately you can place the job in high priority pipeline, otherwise you can put it in a standard priority pipeline

    Jobs

    While creating jobs you can specify the settings regarding the location of the input/output file. From the documentation:
    You can configure Elastic Transcoder to notify you when the status of a job changes, including when Elastic Transcoder starts and finishes processing a job, and when Elastic Transcoder encounters a warning or error condition.

    Presets

    Presets can be considered as templates specify most of the settings for the transcoded media file. Amazon Elastic Transcoder has pre-defined presets for various devices that remove the need to find the right settings for different devices through trial and error. Some of the existing presets provided by AWS transcoder can be seen in below diagram
