    MP4 ==> MPEG4 

    H.264 ==> MPEG4 part10 (AVC) advance video coding ==> video compression standard ==> aim is to  provide good video quality at lowe bitrates ==> also allowed the standards to be applied to wide variety of standards and networks  and systems including low/high bitrate , low/high resolution video , broadcast etc
    Currently there are 3 major vendor-centric streaming formats (all takes H.264 as input)

4) DASH JS
   built on top of MSE
   so work with MSE supported browsers.
   

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTPÂ (DASH) also called MPEG-DASH 
MPEG-DASH is the first adaptive bit-rate HTTP-based streaming solution that is an international standard (ISO/IEC 23009-1)

Dash.js ==> A JavaScript-based library which enables DASH playback via HTML5

built on top of Media Source Extension (MSE) API
so all the browsers which are currently providing MSE support, dash will work in those.
